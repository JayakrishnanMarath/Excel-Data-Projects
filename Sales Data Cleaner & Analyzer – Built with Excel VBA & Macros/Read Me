This project demonstrates how Excel VBA can be used to speed up repetitive tasks like data cleaning, transformation, and visualization for non-technical users or analysts.
This can be implemented in the same way for a big data set with more operations like date formatting, convering blanks to Null or zero, data standardization, creating VBA functions to do perform manual or automatic operations etc.
